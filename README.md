# CRNT Polyglot
Several Chemical Reaction Network Theory (CRNT) tools exist today that run
different analyses on chemical reaction networks. However, these tools
have different file formats and interfaces for entering the reactions.
One must therefore manually re-enter the reactions for each tool, which is
not only tedious but also error-prone.

CRNT Polyglot provides a unified interface for generating the files for
these tools. This means researchers only need to enter the reactions once
and CRNT Polyglot will take care of the rest by generating the equivalent
files for the other tools.
